      Children are incredibly adaptable and resilient.  With positive guidance, they will adapt<br>
      and adjust to the social distancing measures that will be gently encouraged in classes and<br>
      playgrounds. Every safety and health aspect will be worked into the school day in the<br>
      most fun way possible. We do not want to scare our children. Hand washing will feel like<br>
      water play, going into situations where they need to wear their masks will make them feel<br>
      like superheroes, temperature checks will be fun. It is part of our profession to make<br>
      serious work feel like play.  All staff have undergone excessive Covid training and we will<br>
      continue to keep abreast of any changes in this regards</p>

      “Mountain View will offer “Drop-in Childcare” – is an alternative to daycare.<br>
      Working parents and stay-at-home parents alike sometimes find that there are days<br> when
      a little extra help is needed. This program offers occasional, as-needed care for<br> those who
      may already have regular childcare, but find themselves needing additional<br> help because
      of school closings for school holidays, regular provider unavailability or <br>simply when you
      need some time to yourself or to pop into the office.<br><br>
